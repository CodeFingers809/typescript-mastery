# This repository marks all of the concepts I covered in TypeScript.

I have had enough regular JavaScript. Up until now, most of my projects only make use of JS, but as soon as I got into more complex projects, the need for catching bugs before they happen has been slowly and steadily making me more and more inclined towards dedicating my time towards TypeScript.

### Wish me luck!
